// Release notes shown by the "What's new" modal after auto-update.
// One entry per shipped version. The `version` string must match
// the value of app.getVersion() exactly so the launch-time check
// finds it. Items mirror the FeatureCardStack shape: { Icon, title,
// description }.
//
// Adding a release:
//   1. Drop a new object at the *top* of RELEASE_NOTES.
//   2. Use 2–5 items per release. The card stack reads best at that
//      density — beyond 5 the dot indicator gets crowded.
//   3. Lead with what changes the user will *notice*, not refactors.

//   • Brand-new install (no lastSeen): never show. Welcome modal owns

//   • Patch bumps (same major.minor — e.g. 0.4.3 → 0.4.4): never show.
//     These are bug fixes and polish; users don't need a "What's new"
//     modal every single release.
//   • Minor/major bumps (e.g. 0.3.x → 0.4.x): surface the notes block for
//     the new line, matched by major.minor so any patch within it (0.4.4,
//     0.4.7…) still finds the 0.4 showcase. Intermediate skipped versions
//     are intentionally not concatenated — keeps the modal readable.
